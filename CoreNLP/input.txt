Car has plenty of leg room but when seat all the way back the door post blocks your view. Passenger seat is way too low and cannot be adjusted up? No lock on glove box? Poor visability over hood. Road noise excessive, will be changing tires with less than 15,000 K on odometer. Bluetooth will not stay connected? Car does look good though, get complements on a daily basis (Metal Bronze) color. Car has lots of features that are not found on higher priced sedans. Heated rear seats and power folding mirrors are two of them. Wish there was a power outlet that was powered when car is turned off, and wish there was one in the rear or in the trunk like VW. Car is extremely low in the front, looks great but have to be very careful when parking near curb or concrete stops. Dealership is not a well managed place. Employees look like used car dealers from Detroit. When going to the dealer I usually see the entire staff sitting around eating. The place looks and smells like a Deli. They are not very professional and if you are there for any reason (other than giving them a blank check) for a NEW car, they are completely disinterested.
